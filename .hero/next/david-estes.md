# david-estes's handoff

## Session goal

> Listen Apple Music should list personal stations via MSP navigator, not fake folders

_possibly stale — 8 commit(s) since, last set 6h 55m ago_

## Last user ask

> lets deliver it

_possibly stale — 1 commit(s) since, last set 5m ago_

## Suggested next prompt

> deliver experience switch so later lights and climate can add a tab without rewriting Watch and Listen

## Recent reflections

- ui_configuration already has lights/comfort/cameras types; extractRooms skips them on purpose — the open door is an implemented allow-list, not showing every experience
- virtual-remote-numbers only has a live test on Cable DVR 20 (Xfinity X1); Apple TVs must not get a digit pad even though they list NUMBER_*
- Linux color-emoji fonts paint ▶ ⏸ ⏭ orange and ignore QML text color — use words, not media-symbol Unicode
- FileView.setText is async and no-ops on identical text; deleting http-body.json after POST makes the next accountAuth curl exit 26 as Network error
- GetTabList was firing during socket.io subscribe with no poll in flight, so OnDataToUI was dropped.
